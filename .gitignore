# .gitignore
# Mini README:
# Purpose: keeps repository clean by excluding build artifacts, logs, and
#          environment-specific files from version control.
# Structure:
#   - Dependencies
#   - Temporary files
#   - Build artifacts
#   - Logs and runtime data
#   - Environment & OS files
# Usage: Add new patterns under the appropriate section to prevent accidental
#        commits of transient files.

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Temporary files
.tmp

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
public/js/
admin/js/
*.tsbuildinfo

# Logs and runtime data
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Persisted data snapshots
# Allow committed user/account databases and seed data under data/ by default so
# they remain version-controlled.
# Ignore only obvious temporary backups that editors create.
data/*.tmp
data/*~

# Environment & OS files
.env
.DS_Store
